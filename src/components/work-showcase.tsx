When a user scan the barcode, the UPC number is sent to Kroger to fetch an Image, Price and Name of the Item, we then fetch microsoft (authenticated with MSAL) for the users updated shoppinglist, we then format and send all the data to OpenAI and get an LLM to detect if the item from the kroger api is present in the Shopping List, if it is, we allow the user to effortlessly remove the item in one click. yes i do know this is pretty useless ;)",
